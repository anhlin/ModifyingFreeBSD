Assignment 4: Cryptographic File System

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[System Configuration]:
 - 1 CPU
 - 2048 MB RAM

[Instructions]: 

1. Run make in the assgn-4 directory
	- This will copy vfs_syscalls.c and syscalls.master from the src folder into the
	  usr/src/sys/kern directory in the kernel and overwrite the original files. 
	- It will then build, install the kernel, and reboot the system. 

2. Wait for system to reboot. 
3. cd back into the assgn-4 directory
4. chmod +x compile.sh to allow permissions for the compile shell script to build our programs.
5. ./compile.sh to build the programs (protectfile, setkey, fs)
    (-NOTE: If an error about pkgconf is not installed, please install it!
            the build for the fuse program uses the flag: `pkgconf fuse --cflags --libs`)

6. chmod +x mountfs.sh to allow permissions for the mount shell script.
7. chmod +x unmount.sh to allow permissions for the unmount shell script.
8. sudo kldload fuse (loads the FUSE driver/module) (done as root)
9. ./mountfs to mount the FUSE fs for the directory: fusefs (done as root)
10. login to a different user, then cd into the assgn-4/fusefs directory, then from there
    cd back into the assgn-4 directory. (so, the the working directory looks something like: ../assgn-4/fusefs/../assgn-4/)
11. Now, in the assgn-4 directory, the testing can be done. 
        - ./setkey [key] (-NOTE: if no key is specified, then the program unsets the key for the user if the user has a key in the table already)
        - ./.protectfile [-e|--encrypt|-d|--decrypt] [key] [fileName]
