Assignment 3: Page Replacement (Bon Chance Algorithm)

-----------------------------------------------------

[System Configuration]:
 - 1 CPU
 - 2048 MB RAM

[Instructions]: 

1. Run make in the assgn-3 directory
	- This will copy vm_page.c, vm_pageout.c, and vm_phys.c from the src into the
	  usr/src/sys/vm directory in the kernel and overwrite the original files. 
	- It will then build, install the kernel, and reboot the system 

2. Wait for system to reboot. 
3. cd back into the assgn-3 directory
4. chmod +x benchmark.sh to allow permissions for the benchmark shell script.
5. chmod +x switch.sh to allow permissions for the algorithm switch shell script.
6. Switch cases by running ./switch.sh 0 for FreeBSD or ./switch.sh 1 for Bon Chance. 
	(We restarted the VM first before switching to a different case)
7. ./benchmark.sh will run the benchmark for the current case. (We ran the benchmark.sh 5 times for each case)
